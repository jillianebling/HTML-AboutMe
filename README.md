# HTML-AboutMe
This is a project for my Web and Mobile I class that I completed in December of 2022. This is a website that is all about me!
This website contains pages for my resume (and a download link that provides my resume as a PDF file), as well as information about my education, my photography, and an About me page.
This website was not required to be responsive (work on multiple devices) by my instructor, but I wanted it to be, so if you press F12 in chrome, you will be able to play around with the different screen sizes and see how my website responds. Of course, it can still be a little wonky on some desktops, and laptops, and will also not work with all mobile devices, and screen sizes, but I am still happy with the way that it looks overall.
