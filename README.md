# HTML-AboutMe
This is a project for my Web and Mobile I class that I completed in December of 2022. This is a website that is all about me!
This website contains pages for my resume (and a download link that provides my resume as a PDF file), as well as information about my education, my photography, and an About me page.
This website is not responsive (it does not change shape to accomadate many screen sizes), so it can still be a little wonky on some desktops, and laptops, and will also not work with all mobile devices, but I am still happy with the way that it looks overall.
