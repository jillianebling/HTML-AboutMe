        <h4>Outdoors</h4>
        <p>
            I like to go outside whenever I get the chance. Ever since I was little, my dad and I would spend a week in the summer
            on Wellesley Island in the 1000 Islands. My sister and I try to go to the Adirondacks once a year, and I've recently started
            a tradition with my friends of taking a week long trip to Alleghaney State Park in the summer.

            I started really getting into reading just last year. My oldest sister always has given me grief
            over the fact that I used to only read Fiction books, she would always say "why waste your time on fiction?".
            Around this time, I started getting into more scientific books, like "Fossil Men" by Kermit Pattison, and "The Sirens
            of Mars" by Sarah Stewart Johnson. These books led me into Memiors like "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls, and
            "Everything I Know About Love" by Dolly Alderton. Non-Fiction has become one of my favorite genres, and I am looking to
            get into philosophy next.

        <h4>Photography</h4>

        <p>
            My dad got me a Canon Rebel T7i for christmas in 2019, I was supposed to take it to a trip to China
            with my International Studied class, obviously; it didn't work out. I started taking my camera out 
            to the paths in the woods at RIT. I started to take pictures of wildlife, and nature, but I wanted to expand.
            I started by getting into Polaroid cameras, and have recently expanded into film photography. A friend and I even
            develop our own film from time to time. I love taking the time to set up a good photo, and just finding things in the 
            world that I think are beautiful. There is nothing better than scanning in your own film, and getting to see what came out.

            I am still an extremley entry level photographer. I am trying harder to pay attention to composition in my photos, and I can't wait
            to learn how I can improve.
